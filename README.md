# Solder

Hello! I've always wanted to design something of an ALU, but that's far too complicated, so to start, I've made a simple bit adder (with a ring oscillator too!).

### Features
Half-Adder Circuit
- Performs binary addition on two 1-bit inputs using logic gates built from NPN transistors!
- Buttons for input

Ring Oscillator
- A loop of inverters built from transistors that generates a periodic signal to blink an LED!

### Bill of materials 
- 1 Battery holder
- 2 10uF Capacitors
- 12 NPN Transistors
- 15 1k Resistors
- 3 Push Buttons
- 5 LEDs
